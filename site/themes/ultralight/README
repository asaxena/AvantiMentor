WHERE TO START
--------------

Yay! You opened the correct file first. The first thing that people notice when
they download the Ultralight theme is that there are A LOT of files -- way more than
other themes.

Don't worry! You don't need to learn everything all at once in order to make a
drupal theme. Ultralight will do the bits you haven't learned and patiently wait for
you to discover the documentation and inline comments about them.


SUGGESTED READING
-----------------

Installation
  If you don't know how to install a Drupal theme, there is a quick primer later
  in this document.

Theme .info file
  Your theme's .info file holds the basic information about your theme that
  Drupal needs to know: its name, description, features, template regions, CSS
  files, and JavaScript. Don't worry about all these lines just yet.

ONLINE READING
--------------
Excellent documentation on Drupal theming can be found in the Theme Guide:
  http://drupal.org/theme-guide


INSTALLATION
------------

 1. Download Ultralight http://themeforest.net/item/ultralight-clean-and-simple-drupal-6-theme/112375

 2. Unpack the downloaded file, take the entire ultralight folder and place it in your
    Drupal installation under one of the following locations:
      sites/all/themes
        making it available to the default Drupal site and to all Drupal sites
        in a multi-site configuration
      sites/default/themes
        making it available to only the default Drupal site
      sites/example.com/themes
        making it available to only the example.com site if there is a
        sites/example.com/settings.php configuration file

    Please note: you will need to create the "theme" folder under "sites/all/"
    or "sites/default/".

    For more information about acceptable theme installation directories, read
    the sites/default/default.settings.php file in your Drupal installation.

 3. Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to Administer > Site
    building > Themes (admin/build/themes). You will see the ultralight. You can optionally 
    make ultralight the default theme.
