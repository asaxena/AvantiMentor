*** Met mentee to get about his studies & other social life.
*** He is working well but not as hard as required to be IITian.
*** His results are just average, not up to the mark.
*** He work like a normal hard working school topper but he doesn't work with the intelligence that one need for JEE.
*** Inspired him to work hard with full enthu.
*** Gave him some tips on how to manage time & do the course.
*** Things would take time but hope slowly he would make the required change.
